### Project Title
Bikeshare Project

### Description
This Python Script is the second Project of Udacitiy'S Nanodegree "Programming with Python for Data Science"
It is used to explore data related to bike share systems in the United States. It imports data from csv files and
computes descriptive statistics from the data. It also takes in users' raw input to create an interactive
experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

### How to run the Script
You can run the script using a Python integrated development environment (IDE). This script is written in Python 3, so you will need the Python 3.x version of the installer. To read the file, the following software requirements apply:

-You should have Python 3, NumPy, and pandas installed using Anaconda
-A text editor, like Sublime or Atom.
-A terminal application (Terminal on Mac and Linux or Cygwin on Windows).
